            <p className="text-base md:text-lg">
              3D printed parts oftentimes suffer from strong anisotropy, mainly
              due to weak bonds between the layers. Our DEMEX system uses
              continuous spectrum light to heat the substrate just before the
              nozzle, which allows the material to form a complete bond. The
              result is isotropic, high mechanical part performance that is
              achieved repeatedly and reliably, which enables completely new
              possibilities for additive manufacturing.

                With our system you can functionalize and individualize parts
                that are manufactured in another process, such as injection
                molding. It also allows you to print parts from one material,
                interrupt the printing process for material change, and add
                further elements to the part in another material. With DEMEX it
                becomes possible to print on cold surfaces and still achieve
                perfect bonding. You can have the right material at the right
                spot.

                  Parts used in demanding sectors such as aerospace or oil &amp;
                  gas must satisfy the specified mechanical performance and
                  durability. For this purpose, it is necessary to keep track of
                  every detail of the production process. With our systems you
                  can generate a digital twin of your parts. In addition to all
                  relevant machine parameters, the bonding temperature at every
                  position in the part is recorded. This enables the complete
                  and continuous documentation, like a birth certificate for the
                  part, without additional effort for the manufacturer.
